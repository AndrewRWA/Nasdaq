This project was designed to analyze the Nasdaq, and forecast its future using different machine learning models. 
  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forrest (not completed)
  * Arima (not started)

I set out to answer a few questions:
  * Are there certain industries, and stocks that have high correlation that is significant to the index?
  *   For this, I used QQQ to represent the Nasdaq
  * Can I predict 2024 using different training sets?
  * Who has better price control indicating stability?

Tasks:
  * Extract data from yFinance
  * Load data into local SQL Server for perm storage (offline use)
  * Load data into Linear Regression Model
  *   Version 1.1.1 = 2010 - 2023 to predict 2024
  *   Version 1.1.2 = 2023 to predict 2024
  * Report findings of market and models using:
  *   Tableau
  *   PowerBI
